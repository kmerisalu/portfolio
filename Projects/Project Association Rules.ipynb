    "<b>Problem:</b> When financial advisors are giving advice they will sometimes recommend clients to purchase specific assets, based on clients' circumstances. To make financial advisors suggestions potentially more relevant for clients, I will create a recommendation engine based on association rules algorithm, which will be recommending asset purchases to clients based on other clients' investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often times, such an analysis is conducted to analyse people's shopping baskets when making purchases in large grocery stores for example. This will help stores to place items that are bought together close to each other for shoppers' convenience (or not, if they want clients to walk through the whole store to pick up their items). We will try to convert this idea to finance sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using anonymised client investment data grouped by investment class. In more detail, this shows in which asset classes clients are invested in. By using association rules alorithm, we can hopefully draw conclusions from some clients and make recommendations to others. For example: if many clients are invested in Equities, Multi Assets and Real Estate simultaneously then for a client invested only in Equities and Multi Assets it may be interestig to consider adding Real Estate assets (recommendation) to their portfolio."
