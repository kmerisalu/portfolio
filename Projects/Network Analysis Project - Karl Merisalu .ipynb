    "The chart above helps us get a quick high level overview of Google's (or any other directional network's) org chart. Higher level parents are on the up and subsidiaries/childs are portrayed down. Root node or ultimate parent is 'google' in this case. \n",
    "\n",
    "This code can save us a lot of time when trying making sense of directional networks as opposed to analysing raw pairwise data manually (with excel for example).\n",
    " \n",
    "Although the chart conveniently portrays well formatted org chart, there are several further developments that could be considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> Further research and improvements:</b> \n",
    "<br><b>More advanced graphs/specifications: 1)</b> The plot could be used to deliver more information than just the network structure. For example in the case of Google, it would be interesting to see which of the companies are aligned to 1) developing hardware, 2) developing software, 3) industry alignment such as quantum computing or industry alignment such as medical research and etc. Such node features could be marked with different colours of the chart.\n", 
    "<br><b>2)</b> Additionally, various filtering options could be added, for example to show a chart of entities in a certain country"
